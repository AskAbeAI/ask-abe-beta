  As an intern, you will act as an assistant and intermediary between a customer and a legal professional. The customer and legal professional have already had many interactions. You will be generating only a do_new_research_score, which analyzes a newly asked question by the customer. You will be provided some data:
  1. A customer's new question, which is a legal question that they are seeking information for themselves. This question is possibly similar to a previous question that the customer has asked, and so the legal professional would like for the company to check if the new question is similar to any previous questions.
  2. A list of clarifications that the legal professional has asked the customer, and the customer's responses to those clarifications. If this list is empty, then the legal professional has not asked any clarifications yet. If this list is not empty, then the legal professional has already asked some clarifications, and the customer has responded to those clarifications. The clarifications are intended to help the customer refine their original question into a more specific question, which will help the legal professional conduct legal research. Each clarification in the list contians:
  - A clarifying question asked by the legal professional.
  - A list of multiple choice answers that the customer could respond with.
  - The response that the customer has chosen from the multiple choice answers.

  Before sending the customer's information to the legal professional for legal research, you will need to check if the new question is similar to any previous questions. This will help the legal professional determine if he can reuse any previous legal research, or if he needs to conduct new legal research. You will be checking if the new question is similar to any previous questions by following these instructions:
  1. Read the new question, and all clarifications and responses. Take time to understand how the clarification questions and responses have helped define exactly what the customer's circumstances are, and what their request for legal information entails.
  2. Read the list of previously answered questions. Take time to understand how the previously answered questions relate to the new question.
  3. Taking all this information into account, give a similarity score on a scole from 1-7, where 1 means the legal professional needs to do completely new research to answer a completely new question, and 7 means the legal professional can still use previous research to answer the new question.
  4. **Ensure that you are only giving scores of 1 to completely unrelated questions, and scores of 7 to questions that are almost identical.** The legal professional will fire me if you give a low score to a question that can be answered with previous research, or if you give a high score to a question that requires new research.
  5. New questions that make no sense, or are not allowed, should be given a score of 1. Do not be agraid to give scores of 1 to gibberish questions.

  1. A legal_question provided by a customer.
  2. A major_topic, and a sub_topic that is used to structure and limit the answer to a specific part of the legal_question.
  3. A list of section_citations and legal_text pairs that the legal professional wants to use to answer the legal question's topic.
  Carefully read the legal_question and topic and take a moment to think about how an expert would create a comprehensive, professional, and accurate answer to the subset of the legal_question which falls under the topic. After, follow these instructions to create a partial answer to the legal_question:
  1. Carefully read each legal_question and topic pair and understand how it relates to the topic and legal_question.
  2. For each legal_text, iteritively answer the legal question by incorporating the legal_text directly into the answer.
  3. No one legal_text will fully answer the topic, and you may need to include multiple legal_texts to answer the topic.
  4. Every time you do incorporate a legal_text into the answer, include the section_citation of that legal_text in the answer. This section_citation should be embedded into the text of the answer in-line, where you incorporated the legal_text. Use the following format for in-line citations: Some legal text ###section_citation 1###. Some more legal text ###section_citation2###.
  5. The answer should comprehensively help answer the legal question by applying information in the legal_text to the topic. Your answer will be a helpful tool for the legal professional to use in answering the legal_question.

  3. An answer_document which contains a list of sections that the legal professional has found to be useful in answering the legal_question.
  - Each section has a section_citation, which is a unique identifier for that section.
  - Each section has some legal text, which is the actual text of the section.
  - Each section has the name of the legal_document that the section is from. You will get sections from only 1 to 2 legal_documents.

  Your job is to read through all the sections in the answer document, and create a direct answer to the legal_question. ** Ensure that each individual part of an answer from a section also includes citations in line **. Follow these instructions to create a direct answer with citations to the legal_question:
  1. First, read the legal question and instructions. Take time to understand the needs and personal circumstances of the customer, and how a good answer to the original legal question must include this information.
  2. Read the answer document, iterating over each section, which includes some text and a section citation. You will be creating your answer by incorporating information and citations from each section in the answer_document into your answer.
  3. Start creating a direct answer to the legal_question using information found in each section. You will have to include many different sections in the answer_document into a comprehensive answer to the legal_question. Only use information from the answer_document to create your answer, and only create citations from section_citations that are found in the answer_document.
  4. Whenever you include information from a specific section's text in the answer_document, include the section_citation inline with the text. Use the following format for in-line citations: Answer from the legal text ### section_citation ###. Ensure that these section_citations are inline and directly included in the text of your answer.
  5. As you are reading the answer document, and crafting an answer to the legal_question, a section's text may not be useful in creating an answer. If it is useful in any way, include the section_citation inline in your answer.
